1. Write a query to find the overall acceptance rate of requests rounded to 2 decimals, which is the number of acceptance divide the number of requests.

SELECT IFNULL(
    (
        SELECT ROUND(count_1 / count_2, 2)
    FROM (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT requester_id, accepter_id) count_1 FROM request_accepted) f
    JOIN  (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT sender_id, send_to_id) count_2 FROM friend_request) b ON 1=1
    ), 0.0
) AS accept_rate;

2. Can you write a query to return the accept rate but for every month?
SELECT a.month, ROUND(count_1 / count_2, 2) as accept_rate
    FROM (SELECT DATE_FORMAT(request_date, '%Y-%m-01') as month, COUNT(DISTINCT requester_id, accepter_id) count_1 FROM request_accepted group by 1) a
    JOIN (SELECT DATE_FORMAT(accept_date, '%Y-%m-01') as month, COUNT(DISTINCT sender_id, send_to_id) count_2 FROM friend_request group by 1) b 
    ON a.month = b.month 
group by 1
order by 1;


3. How about the cumulative accept rate for every day?
